# locoTransmitter
DIY transmitter for garden railway locomotives

## Sumary

locoTransmitter is a Arduino-based project to build my own remote controller for controlling battery powered and live steam locomotives on 45mm track (garden railway). It uses the [DIY Multiprotocol TX Module](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/) from Pascal Langer (big thanks, great work!).

At the moment I am testing my code and hardware and after some refactoring and code cleanup I plan to publish my code, drawings and 3D models here.
